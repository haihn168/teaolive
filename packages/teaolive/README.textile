h2. A Dart Testing Framework

Teaolive is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for Dart. It does not rely on browser. Thus it's suited for Server Application or Web Application.
I like Jasmine Test Framework. (http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/)
It's really cool when use with CoffeeScript.

h2. How to run

# on command line
$ dart example/usage_for_commandline.dart
# on browser
open example/teaolive.html by Dartium or any other browser.
# on CI
$ dart example/usage_for_ci.dart
$ cat junit_output.xml

Do you know someone how to running browser test on CI? phantom-js?
